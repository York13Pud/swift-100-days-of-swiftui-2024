# Conditions

## If statements

When checking if a var or const is empty, the best method to check it is with the `isEmpty` check. For example:

``` swift
var myString = "Hello world!"

if myString.isEmpty { // isEmpty is a boolean so no need to compare it with == true
    myString = "I was empty but now I'm not!"
}
```

## Logical Operators

&& = And
|| = Or
