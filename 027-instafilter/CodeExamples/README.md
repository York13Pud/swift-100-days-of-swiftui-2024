#  SwiftUI, CoreImage And UIKit Image Handling

## SwiftUI - Image

In SwiftUI, the `Image` view is used to show an image. It does not offer any options to modify the image directly.

Modifiers such as `.resizable()` and `.scaledToFit()` only perform sizing on the screen. They do not change the actual image file.
